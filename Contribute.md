# Get Involved #

There are many ways to get involved.

  * **Be active and helpful on the mailing lists**

  * **Find bugs**
    * Submit issues with failing unit tests
    * Submit patches that make the tests pass

  * **Create a new feature or modification**
    * Discuss your changes on the user mailing list to get feedback from the community
    * Submit new feature to the issue tracking system with passing tests
    * Attach the patch file (or even just the complete files if that works... we can diff easily enough)

  * **Write documentation**
    * Submit documentation contributions or changes directly in the body of the issue (which supports wiki markup).  We'll add it to the official guide.
