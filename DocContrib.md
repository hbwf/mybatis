You make the best author of the documentation, because you are a user of the framework and therefore have a better perspective for what it takes to explain and use MyBatis.

There are a few ways you can contribute to the documentation:

  * Checkout the xdoc manual from http://mybatis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/site or the wiki from http://mybatis.googlecode.com/svn/wiki, modify it, create a patch and fill an [Issue](http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/issues/list) with it.

  * Submit an issue with the description containing the newly created documents that you'd like to contribute (Issue Tracker supports wiki formatting).

  * Make a request to the user list regarding documentation that is missing.
