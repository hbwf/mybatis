# Contributor License Agreement #

MyBatis desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to MyBatis projects complete, sign, and submit (via email) an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://mybatis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ICLA) (CLA). The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to MyBatis and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed CLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to MyBatis project.

CLAs may be submitted by traditional postal mail, fax, or by emailing a scan of the signed copy to Clinton Begin or Simone Tripodi.
